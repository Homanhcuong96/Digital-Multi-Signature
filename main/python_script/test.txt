For this publication, we invited developers of tools to prepare tutorials that explain how their tools work and what they can do. The issue also includes many interviews from which we can learn plenty of interesting things - about the tools and about the developers themselves. This edition has a number of goals, first and foremost we hope that you will learn a lot of new things, but also improve your skillset, expand your toolbox and maybe get inspired to create a forensic open-source tool on your own! Every tool presented can be found on GitHub or GitLab (links are provided inside), so if you want to support the author, we encourage you to do so!
